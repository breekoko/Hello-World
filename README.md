# Hello-World
The is the GitHub Tutorial

This is on readme-edit and my second experience with GitHub.  I look forward to working on coding projects of various types
as I grow in knowledge and experience.  So far, I have been learning Python and I am hooked and hungry for more knowledge.
I just recently received my Honor Certificate from MIT for their Intro to Computing class on EDX.  The class was extraordinary.
I am now in the second part of that series.
